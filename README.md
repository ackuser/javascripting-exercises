# JAVASCRIPTING-EXERCISES

Javascript homeworks from https://github.com/sethvincent/javascripting done by myself. I want to say thanks to them for providing us this kind of tools.


## Motivation

* I want to get the nodejs certificate.
* Just to make sure I have all the basic skills on javascript
* Some basic examples and tasks about javascript.
* Having my own draft and getting a trace of everything I am doing in javascript.

Interactive tutorials are one of the best way to learn and practise your skills and improve yourself as a good programmer.


## Installation


Make sure Node.js is installed on your computer.

Install it from nodejs.org/download
Install javascripting with npm

Open your terminal and run this command:

```
npm install --global javascripting
```

And here's some of the code with the description of the tasks :

-------------------
## Example of task

arrays/arrays.js

An array is a list of values. Here's an example:

```javascript
var pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'rat'];
```

The challenge:

Create a file named arrays.js.

In that file define a variable named pizzaToppings that references an array that contains three strings in this order: tomato sauce, cheese, pepperoni.

Use console.log() to print the pizzaToppings array to the terminal.



```javascript
var pizzaTopings = ['tomato sauce', 'cheese', 'pepperoni'];
console.log(pizzaTopings);
```
## Run

To run my own solutions for all the tasks, it needs to be done

```
javascripting verify folder/file.js
```
